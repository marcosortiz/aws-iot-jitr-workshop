## Binary tools

This section features two binary tools which can be used with this stack :

 - The [`certificate-scripts`](./certificate-scripts) which contains shell scripts which will create a Root CA and create device certificates.
 - The [`device-simulator`](./device-simulator) which allows testers to connect and provision dozens of devices on their account using a given Root CA.

 Each binary tool has its own documentation which you can access by clicking on each one of the tool directory.
